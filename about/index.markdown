# About me

## Short version
I am a South African, currently working as a system engineer in Japan. 

## Long version
I love learning new things, in particular languages. This is what brought me to Japan in the first place, wanting to learn more Japanese. Since then I've fallen in love with the country-side and food here, and I am staying for the long term. In general I have a wide range of interests, and like being challenged intellectually.

I've recently started learning Russian in addition to Japanese and I will be sharing some posts on the topic.

My other interests include programming and engineering topics and gaming. Scala and Java are my main programming languages, but I am learning Rust as well. I am also capable in C++, PHP and Javascript. I believe strongly in the automation of testing and release procedures.

When it comes to gaming I am a big fan of games by Paradox Interactive, CCP and Eugen Systems. A good game of chess also never goes out of fashion!
